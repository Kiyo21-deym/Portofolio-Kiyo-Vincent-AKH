# Kiyo Vincent — Personal Portfolio
**A clean, accessible, framework-free portfolio built to reflect who I am as a developer and creator.**

---

## About the Project

Built with HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks, no build tools. The design follows a component-based architecture using CSS custom properties, keeping the code modular and easy to maintain. Every interaction, from theme switching to form validation, is hand-written to demonstrate genuine understanding of the web platform rather than reliance on abstractions.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design** — Mobile-first layout with a hamburger menu, smooth transitions, and adaptive components across all screen sizes.
- **Dark / Light Theme Switching** — One-click toggle with preference persisted via `localStorage`; defaults to dark mode on first visit.
- **Interactive Project Gallery** — Click-driven preview switcher lets visitors explore projects without leaving the page.
- **Contact Form with Validation** — Real-time field validation on blur and input, with accessible error messaging and simulated async submission feedback.
- **Smooth Navigation UX** — Scroll-offset anchor navigation, a scroll-triggered header effect via CSS class toggling, and automatic menu close on link click.

## Future Objectives

- **Backend form handling** — Connect the contact form to a real endpoint (e.g., Formspree or a lightweight Node server).
- **Expanded project section** — Add more case studies with detailed write-ups as new work ships.
- **Scroll animations** — Introduce subtle entrance animations using the Intersection Observer API for a more polished feel.
